my primary focus at the moment is on building an open source platform for people to live cooperatively together.

i imagined people would be best suited by self-grouping into communities. i called these 'hives', but now found out to be best described as 'holons'. as always, someone had already thought of what i was thinking: http://www.worldtrans.org/hw/

now the question is how to serve software to holons.

what do holons do?

here's what we came up with so far:

- organize, plan, document actions
- decide on actions
- read and send messages
- track and exchange inventory
